# FrisPy
This is a frisbee flight simulator written (mostly) in python.

# Purpose
In order to predict how a frisbee is going to fly when thrown, in addition to knowing the initial conditions of the throw, such as the position and velocity, one must also know a small set of "parameters" that describe how the forces and torques scale.
